                    Legendary icon Rajinikanth was honoured at the closing ceremony today as he marked an extraordinary
                    50 years in Indian cinema—a golden milestone that underscores his unmatched influence on the
                    country's cinematic landscape. Addressing the audience with his trademark humility, the superstar
                    expressed heartfelt gratitude to the Central Government for the special felicitation.

                    “When I look
                    back, it feels like these five decades have passed in a moment—because cinema is my life. If given a
                    choice, I would choose to be an actor, as Rajinikanth, for a hundred lifetimes. Thank you for your
                    immense love and support. This honour is dedicated to the entire film fraternity—producers,
                    directors, technicians, distributors, exhibitors, and every individual who contributes to the magic
                    of cinema,” he shared.
