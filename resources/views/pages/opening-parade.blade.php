                For the first time ever, IFFI Goa introduced a <b>Grand Opening Parade</b>, bringing a new 
                energy to the festival. The parade filled the streets with colourful floats, live cultural 
                acts, and artists from across the country, creating a lively start to this year’s 
                celebrations.

                A special moment of the parade will be the felicitation of noted actor <strong>N. Balakrishna</strong>, for his remarkable contribution to Indian cinema.

                This first-ever parade has set a refreshing new tradition for IFFI, welcoming guests, 
                filmmakers, and cine lovers with colour, music, and the joyful spirit of cinema.
