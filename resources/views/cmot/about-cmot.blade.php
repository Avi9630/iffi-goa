                            Creative Minds of Tomorrow (CMOT) is a visionary initiative by the Ministry of Information &
                            Broadcasting (MoIB) and the National Film Development Corporation (NFDC), designed to discover,
                            nurture, and spotlight the rising stars of the Indian film industry. It's not just a talent
                            program — it's a launchpad for the storytellers of the future, who will drive India's
                            creative economy.
