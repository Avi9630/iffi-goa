                        In its third edition, the Gala Premieres and Red-Carpet segment at IFFI continues to get bigger and
                        better in its third edition. With a spectacular line-up of renowned names from the world of cinema,
                        Gala Premieres, in the last two years, have added the buzz to the red carpet making it glitzy and
                        glamorous. Launched with the idea of bridging the gap between audiences and stars, gala premieres
                        and red carpet allows a platform to see and know stars up, close and personal, as they attend the
                        festival for the World, Asia and India premieres of their respective films.
                    </p>

                        Interactions, among several others, which brought a fine blend of genres catering to a vast spectrum
                        of cinephiles. Making the red carpet at IFFI the most sought after, we have had noted celebrities
                        such as Salman Khan, Ajay Devgn, Aditi Rao Hydari, Nawazzudin Siddiqui, Manoj Bajpayee, Varun
